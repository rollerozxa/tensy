A simple but addictive puzzle game. Your mission is to match numbers such that they add up to 10. Simply tap and drag to make a selection and make sure the numbers add up to 10!

The scoring system works by multiplying the amount of cells you have selected. More selected cells mean more score!

Play different game modes each with its unique twist:

- Classic: Collect as much score as possible within the time limit
- Gravity: Numbers will fall down, as if they are affected by gravity.
- Infinite: Numbers fall from above to replace removed ones. Forever.
- Leisure: Infinite time, infinite shuffles, infinite calm.
- Lucky: I'm feeling lucky!
- And a secret game mode...
