A simple but addictive puzzle game. Your mission is to match numbers such that they add up to 10. Simply click and drag with your mouse or tap and drag on mobile to make a selection and make sure the numbers add up to 10!

The game currently runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, the Web, Android, Haiku OS and the PlayStation Vita (homebrew).

It is slated to release on itch.io sometime in the future. For now you can try out the in-development web version at [tensy.voxelmanip.se](https://tensy.voxelmanip.se).
