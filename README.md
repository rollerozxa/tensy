<h1 align="center">Tensy</h1>

A simple but addictive puzzle game. Your mission is to match numbers such that they add up to 10. Simply click and drag with your mouse or tap and drag on mobile to make a selection and make sure the numbers add up to 10!

The game currently runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, the Web, Android, Haiku OS and the PlayStation Vita (homebrew). It is currently still in early development, but for now there are builds of the game [available for download here](https://github.com/rollerozxa/tensy/releases/tag/rolling) that get automatically built on each commit.
